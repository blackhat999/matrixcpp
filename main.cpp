okay so it looks like i should split this into three parts:

(1): the parser: converts a 1d text entry (iostream obj) into a 2d matrix
(2): the martrix class: takes care of storing the 2d matrix in memory
(3): the matrix operators: manipulate the matrix
*/

void opParse(char, class )

void main(int argc){
    
    if(argc == 3 || argc == 2)
    else{
    std::cout << "Please enter the first matrix: "
    std::cin >> Matrix m1;
    std::cin >> char op;
    std::cin >> Matrix m2;
    std::cout << opParse()
    }
}

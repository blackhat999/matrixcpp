# matrixcpp
A simple C++ matrix library.

The matrix is implemented as a template<class>, allowing it to contain ints, longs, floats, doubles, and even user defined types (if they have multipy, divide, add, and subtract operators).

The code for this project should be working by August 15th, 2015.

See you then!

P.S. I am new to Git, so I will wait to upload the code until it actually works. Until then, you can view the latest *pre-pre-alpha* version here: [https://preview.c9.io/blackhat9991/matrix-cpp-standalone](https://preview.c9.io/blackhat9991/matrix-cpp-standalone).

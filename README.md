# matrixcpp
A simple C++ matrix library. (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

The matrix is implemented as a template<class>, allowing it to contain ints, longs, floats, doubles, and even user defined types (if they have multipy, divide, add, and subtract operators).

Why is this different than other C++ matrix libraries? It's avalible under the Unlicensce or the CC0 (your choice) and is free of any usage restricions!

The code for this project should be working by August 15th, 2015. Until then, you can view the latest *pre-pre-alpha* version here: [https://preview.c9.io/blackhat9991/matrix-cpp-standalone](https://preview.c9.io/blackhat9991/matrix-cpp-standalone).

See you then!

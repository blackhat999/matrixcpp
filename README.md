# matrixcpp
A simple C++ matrix library. (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

The matrix is implemented as a template<class>, allowing it to contain ints, longs, floats, doubles, and even user defined types (if they have multipy, divide, add, and subtract operators).

Why is this different than other C++ matrix libraries? It's avalible under the Unlicensce or the CC0 (your choice) and is free of any usage restricions!
